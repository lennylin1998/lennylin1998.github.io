At Here@Illinois, I worked on a production system used daily by instructors and students, where small decisions had real downstream impact. I owned features across the stack, from redesigning the lecturer management experience to building a real-time attendance editing table that replaced fragile CSV workflows. Much of the challenge wasn’t technical novelty, but coordinating data consistency, UI state, and backend behavior as the product grew. I often had to reason about where logic should live, how changes in one part of the system would affect others, and how to evolve the codebase without disrupting existing users. That experience shaped how I approach engineering today: thinking in systems, designing for change, and treating software as something people rely on, not just something that works.
