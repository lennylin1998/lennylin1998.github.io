The Binox course project started as a curiosity for me—I spent time browsing existing puzzles and solvers just to understand how people approached the problem before writing a single line of code. I built the original solver myself as a way to ground our ideas in something concrete, and that quickly shaped the team’s brainstorming around variants and rule twists. I naturally stepped into organizing the work: turning scattered ideas into an implementation plan, clarifying boundaries between components, and keeping everyone aligned as we built in parallel. When puzzle generation began taking far too long, it became clear that brute force wasn’t going to scale. I experimented with different approaches and ended up combining statistical insights with a backtracking-based method to shrink the search space dramatically. That moment—when a stalled system finally felt responsive—was one of the most satisfying parts of the project, and it reflected how I like to work: explore first, commit thoughtfully, and adjust when reality pushes back.
