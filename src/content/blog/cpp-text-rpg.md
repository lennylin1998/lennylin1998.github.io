The C++ text-based RPG was a course project designed to push us beyond isolated language features and into building a cohesive system. Using inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and static factories, I modeled core game concepts such as battles, monsters, items, and chests in a way that allowed behaviors to vary without hard-coding logic everywhere. As the game grew, I layered in more complex mechanics—poison over time, attack buffs, defense debuffs, and conditional effects—which forced me to think carefully about state, ownership, and how systems interact across turns. Getting these mechanics to compose cleanly was more challenging than implementing them individually, and it exposed the trade-offs between flexibility and complexity in object-oriented design. Working directly in C++ made those decisions feel concrete, from memory management to interface boundaries, and the project helped me develop an intuition for structuring larger systems rather than just writing features in isolation.
